# AKB OGR

[![AKB OGR](./images/ogr.jpg)](./images/ogr.jpg)

The OGR was originally designed as an entry for the OG Summer competition on [r/customkeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomKeyboards/) in 2019, which it thankfully won. It was originally inspired by various vintage keyboards, but chiefly the [Cherry/NCR G81-3077](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_G81-3077) for the iconic Cherry nose, the pronounced seam and the large forehead. It also drew inspiration from the Cherry G80-0832 for the accented piece around the keycaps to give it a truly unique look. The name is a portmanteau of OG Summer and NCR, whose branding on the aforementioned G81-3077 was also the inspiration for the retro-styled AKB logo. While the PCB is USB-C compatible, the port is enclosed deep inside the case and the case parts gently clamp the cable down to give the aesthetic of a hard-wired cable.
